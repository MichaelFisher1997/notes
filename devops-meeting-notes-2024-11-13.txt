wrappers around multidev list and delete

multidevs:
regular site to find old branches and how old it is and who made it (or last pushed to it) then notify them.
would neeed to get multidevs list and then find the branches related to the.

branch protection:
look at adding it for build fail- mike, key, mat to be able to over ride.

Client obligations:
solving the issue of them responding late to us on things like site updates.

deployment notifications:
slack channel, all deployments to all mulitdevs to go to this channel.



Side notes for us devops:
gonna need a lot of work on updating deployment scripts.
Can we agree one changes now, so we can just make one big update to them all so we are not going around in circles?
Lets get branch protection on important sites 1st, as we don't have a corporate account we have to set it up manually on each site?
